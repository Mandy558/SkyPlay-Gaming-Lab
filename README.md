# SkyPlay: Cloud GPU Gaming Lab

🚀 **Real-time rendering. RTX benchmarks. Remote power.**

**SkyPlay** is building a cloud-based GPU benchmarking platform for gaming and rendering workloads. Our mission is to explore performance trends in high-end games (like *GTA V* and *Red Dead Redemption 2*) using RTX-capable cloud VMs.

We measure:
- Frame rendering latency
- Bandwidth usage
- Mod performance (ENB, NVE, LSPDFR)
- CPU-GPU bottlenecks across providers

🔧 **Tools:** Google Cloud, RunPod, Paperspace, Playit, Steam, OBS

🧪 **Use Case:** Ideal for devs testing high-fidelity game mods, streamers running portable gaming setups, and researchers modeling latency in virtualized environments.

> This is an experimental project exploring the limits of cloud gaming using open benchmarks and modded workloads.
